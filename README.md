# Ubatuba_COVID-19

This work was developed as a demonstration of some of the technologies and techniques used in stages of the data analysis process. :beginner::brazil:  
I'm currently working on improving its documentation.

The project consists of an analysis of data on the covid-19 pandemic in the city of Ubatuba, on the northern coast of the state of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil. And a data application, which displays some information about this data dynamically.
